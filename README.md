Haom (Household Applications On Mobile)

In recent times, it has become difficult for people to go out for household items. Access to services such as grocery shopping, paying bills, managing finances and even entertainment is very limited due to the effects of covid. The app is a means to help solve this problem by enabling the common people to get the services required by staying safe and keeping the community safe.

By designing the user friendly app, HAOM, I aim to help the general public access the services they need within the comfort and safety of their homes. They would be able to lookup updates from the government and plan ahead for any appointments they may have. By guiding the user to the appropriate and correct websites to access services, the app will ensure a secure and trustworthy portal to online shopping and services.

The app will be useful to users of different age groups, but would be highly beneficial to people above 18years of age. For families, it is a good way of browsing for groceries, planning travels and vacations, managing finances. The emergency services function in the app is useful for everyone including children and old people.
